📌 Overview

SG SAFECOIN CORE is the foundational engine of the SG SafeCoin digital currency system.
It provides the essential components required to build a secure, sovereign, AI-enhanced financial infrastructure, designed for long-term scalability and global resilience.

This core does not rely on third-party exchanges or custodial platforms.
It is engineered for user sovereignty, offline resilience, and SG-level security.

⸻

🏛 Core Principles

SG SafeCoin is built on four fundamental values:
   •   Patience — foundational systems are crafted carefully
   •   Discipline — every module follows strict SG architecture
   •   Perseverance — continuous iteration and refinement
   •   Vision — designed for long-term global impact

🧩 Core Components

The SG SAFECOIN CORE establishes the following:

1. Biometric + Multi-Fingerprint Security Layer

A multi-factor authentication system engineered for user-sovereign asset protection.

2. NFC Wristband Wallet Engine

Supports offline, secure, and instant Near-Field Communication transactions.

3. Offline / Air-Gap Safety Protocols

Critical operations can run without internet, reducing cyber-risk and ensuring continuity.

4. Atomic Transaction Integrity Model

Ensures transactions are immutable, verified, and cryptographically sealed.

5. SG-Level Encryption Architecture

Hybrid cryptographic model with SG-standard security layers.

6. User Sovereignty Engine

Prevents centralized control and ensures ownership remains with the user.

7. Private / Public Repo Architecture

Core logic is protected in private repositories.
Public repositories contain documentation, diagrams, and developer-safe modules.
